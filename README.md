# SetBasedSCC
PVL file for the verification of a set-based SCC model checking algorithm using VerCors.

Verified with VerCors 1.3.0, with the pass ```gen-triggers``` disabled in ```Main.java``` and support for tuple and set comprehension syntax added to ```JavaSyntax.java```.

Refer to https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors for further information on VerCors and PVL.
